About App
Git Finder - Search github users.

Created with React.js (create-react-app).

This app was built in response to an interview test exercise.

Luckily nobody got injured during the process of making this app ":)"

I learnt a lot during the coding process and hope this repo might be of some use to you.


Improvements I would have made.
One aspect I would like to improve would be in the pagination and Home components, I belive that methods can be rewritten using a more DRY approach.

I also would like to carryout unit tests on my dev-branch repo as well as ensure the views are responsive and accessible.

I would have also liked to add a spinner to indicate to the user that something was happening in the background.

I would consider add context api or redux depending on the extent to which I desire to scale the app. Personally I feel adding a store to the app now will be a bit of an overkill.


Credits
I will like to give credit to Kasper Mikiewicz for using his CSS only modal codepen.

I will also like to thank all the great people at Github for puting together the wonderful restful api that was used to create this project.
